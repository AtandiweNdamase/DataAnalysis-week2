OLTPs- data stored in rows and columns , data is highly detailed, flexible schema , database is very fast at querying.
Star schema - is a schema diagram with a star shaped connection with the fact diagram at the centre
Intergration: Data from transactional systems flow into data warehouses and data marts for analysis
You need to retrieve, reshape, and insert data to move data between operational and analytical environments
One approach is known as extract, transform, and load (ETL)
